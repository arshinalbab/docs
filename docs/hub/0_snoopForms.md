## Feature Overview

- **Flexible Data Piping:** Pipe your data where you need it. Don’t wait for your form provider to finally build the integration you need.
- **100% Data Ownership:** Since you can self-host snoopForms, you don't need any Data Processing Agreements to be compliant with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPPA, etc.).
