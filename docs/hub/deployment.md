The easiest way to deploy snoopPlatform on your own server is using Docker.

### Requirements

To use this manual, you have to have Docker and docker-compose running on your system.

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/snoopForms/snoopforms.git && cd snoopforms
```

### 2. Create .env file

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and change it according to your setup.

```
cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```

### 3. Run Docker

Start the docker-compose process to build and spin up the snoopPlatform container as well as the postgres database.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You app should be up and running now wherever you deployed it.
