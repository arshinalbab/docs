# snoopForms React Library

snoopReact is one of currently two ways to create forms (the other one is a No-Code builder which is part of the [snoopHub](/category/snoopHub))

## Feature Overview _(in progress)_

- **Pre-built input components:** snoopReact aims to contain a complete list of pre-built input components incl. all types of questions, star ratings, NPS score, payments, flexible file uploads, and more.
- **Comprehensive validation:** Validate all kinds of inputs client-side to keep your data tidy.
- **Built-in state-management:** If you build more complex forms with multiple pages, snoopReact takes care of state management and showing the right page for the user.
- ** One-stop shop:** snoopReact includes form styling, validation, generation, error handling and more.

## React Library and snoopHub

The snoopForms React Library is deeply integrated with the snoopHub, our nocode form creation and submission collection server. Without adding additional code you can use the snoopHub to save your form submissions, view and analyze your submissions or pipe the data to your other systems. But if you want to only use the React Library and manage submissions yourself it's also possible.
