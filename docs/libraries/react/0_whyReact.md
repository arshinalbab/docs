# snoopForms React Library

The snoopForms React Lib is one of currently two ways to create forms (the other one is a No-Code builder in [snoopPlatform](/category/snoopplatform))

## Feature Overview _(in progress)_

- **Pre-built input components:** snoopForms aims to contain a complete list of pre-built input components incl. all types of questions, star ratings, NPS score, payments, flexible file uploads, and more.
- **Comprehensive validation:** Validate all kinds of inputs client-side to keep your data tidy.
- **Built-in state-management:** Manage state of your form inputs to enable saved progress, form-wide undo/redo, multiplayer mode and server-side events.
- ** One-stop shop:** snoopForms includes form styling, validation, generation, error handling, custom inputs and more.
